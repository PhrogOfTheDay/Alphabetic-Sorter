# Alphabetic-Sorter
Usually the default sort in javascript faces issues when sorting through strings which have both uppercase and lowercase letters, which is why I created this !
It can be added to your own project by simply downloading the script.js file and including it in the head of your project. From then on, simply use String.noCaseSort()
